This repository contains a matlab implementation of the wave equation in first order formulation on a staggered
grid in one dimension. This code can reproduce the work presented in:

* O'Reilly, Ossian and Dunham, Eric M. 
*Provably stable and high-order accurate finite difference schemes on staggered grids and their potential application for seismic hazard analysis*, Southern California Earthquake Center Annual Meeting, Palm Springs, California, USA. (Poster presentation). 

Compiling the poster requires the lualatex compiler. Compile the figures in poster/figures using the provided Makefile
before compiling the poster.
